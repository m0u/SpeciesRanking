### 🔥 Pipeline Steps

1. Load Ecopath input:
   - biomass
   - diet matrix
   - keystone ranking

2. Compute features:
   ✓ RTI from diet flow  
   ✓ Network centrality (PR, Degree, Betweenness)  
   ✓ Biomass scaling

3. Train 3 ranking models:
   - Random Forest
   - Label Propagation
   - GraphSAGE GNN

4. Generate ensemble ranking using weighted voting

5. Export output as CSV + Excel for ecological interpretation
