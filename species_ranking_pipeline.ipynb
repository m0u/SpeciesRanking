Species Influence & Keystone Ranking Pipeline

This script implements a cross-ecosystem pipeline to predict species importance
and generate keystone-like rankings using three models and an ensemble:

    1. Random Forest Regressor (feature-based)
    2. Label Propagation (semi-supervised graph-based)
    3. GraphSAGE (graph neural network)

The workflow is:

1. Load Ecopath-derived input data:
   - diet_matrix_ecosystemX.xlsx  (trophic interaction / diet composition matrix)
   - biomass_ecosystemX.xlsx      (biomass values per functional group)
   - rank_ecosystemX.xlsx         (Ecopath keystone / reference ranking for training)

2. Construct features for each ecosystem using:
   - RTI (Relative Total Impact) derived from diet matrix
   - Graph-based metrics: PageRank, degree, in-degree, out-degree,
     closeness, betweenness
   - Biomass as a key ecological trait

3. Normalize feature matrices across ecosystems using MinMax scaling.

4. Train models:
   - RandomForestRegressor on (X_train, y_train) from ecosystems 1, 2, 7
   - LabelPropagation on all nodes (labeled + unlabeled)
   - GraphSAGE-based regression on a k-NN graph built from feature space

5. Generate predictions for the test ecosystem (ecosystem 3 here) and
   compute a weighted ensemble ranking:
   - RF, LP, GNN predictions are converted to ranks
   - Final ensemble rank = weighted combination (weights: RF=1, LP=3, GNN=3)

6. Save outputs:
   - ensemble_rank_ecosystem4.csv
   - predicted_ranks_ecosystem3_canada.csv
   - predicted_ranks_ecosystem3_canada.xlsx with separate sheets:
       * RF  – Random Forest rank
       * LP  – Label Propagation rank
       * GS  – GraphSAGE rank
       * EM  – Ensemble rank

Optional (commented out in the script):
   - Top-k overlap evaluation against Ecopath keystone ranking
   - Top-k overlap curves visualization for RF / LP / GS / Ensemble

Requirements:
   - Python 3.x
   - pandas, numpy, networkx, scikit-learn, matplotlib
   - torch, torch_geometric

This script is intended to be run as a standalone analysis pipeline and is
fully reproducible given the matching Ecopath-derived input files.
